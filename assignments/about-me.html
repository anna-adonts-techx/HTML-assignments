    <h1>Anna Adonts</h1>
    <p>
    Hello, my name is Anna. I have a strong interest in programming and continuous learning, 
    especially in areas like Python, Django, and data science. Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring 
    new ideas, challenging myself with creative projects, and watching films: I try to watch at 
    least one movie each day as it inspires me and broadens my perspective.
